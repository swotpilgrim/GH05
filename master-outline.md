# VENGEANCE #5: NEON KNIGHTS - MASTER OUTLINE

## ACT 1: SETUP (Chapters 1-8)

### Chapter 1: "The Boyfriend"

Kelly serving drinks at Golden Nugget, watches Tommy deal blackjack across floor. Establishes their relationship through her observations—he's good kid, trying to save money, treats her right. After shift they meet at apartment, talk about leaving Vegas someday. He's nervous about something, won't say what. She notices but doesn't push. Chapter ends with them in bed, happy, doomed. Establishes normal life before it shatters. Body count: 0. Running total: 0.

### Chapter 2: "The Witness"

Tommy's POV (only chapter not from Kelly's perspective). Three nights ago he witnessed Frank Castellano and two enforcers skimming casino profits in back room—saw the count, the cash, everything. Knows he should forget it, can't. Tells Kelly he saw something he shouldn't have, thinking about going to Gaming Commission. She tells him mob owns Gaming Commission, let it go. He says he can't. They argue. He leaves for work. Last time she sees him alive. Body count: 0. Running total: 0.

### Chapter 3: "Desert Retirement"

Kelly works double shift. Tommy doesn't come home. She calls casino—he never showed for shift. Panic rising. Calls hospitals, police—nothing. Two days missing. Diane (head cocktail waitress) pulls her aside, says word on floor is Tommy witnessed the skim, Torrino's people took him. Kelly doesn't believe it until detective calls day three: body found in desert, single gunshot back of head. She identifies him at morgue. Chapter ends with her standing over his body, something breaking inside her. Body count: 1 (Tommy, backstory). Running total: 1.

### Chapter 4: "The Inheritance"

Kelly at their apartment, packing Tommy's things. Finds his dealer notebooks—he documented everything he saw. Names, dates, amounts. Frank Castellano running the skim, Torrino ordering it. Tommy was building case like idiot boy scout. She reads it all, memorizes the names. Goes to her own storage unit, retrieves father's .38 revolver (hasn't fired it in six years). Cleans it, loads it, practices draw in mirror. Decision made without words—she's going to kill every name in that notebook. Body count: 0. Running total: 1.

### Chapter 5: "The Courier"

Kelly stakes out Golden Nugget service entrance, knows mob courier runs cash to Torrino every Friday 2am. She waits in parking lot wearing black, face covered. Courier (Paulie Romano's assistant, nervous kid) exits with briefcase. She follows to his car, puts gun to his head, takes briefcase. Fifty thousand in cash. Kid's terrified, she tells him: "Tell Torrino this is for Tommy Delano." Lets him run. Opens briefcase in motel room—more money than she's ever seen. Uses it to buy weapons, ammunition, supplies from pawn shops and criminal contacts. War chest established. Body count: 0. Running total: 1.

### Chapter 6: "First Blood"

Kelly walks into Torrino's social club (Lucky Seven Pawn Shop) mid-afternoon. Four guys playing cards in back room—two enforcers, two associates. She asks for Torrino. They laugh, tell her he don't see cocktail waitresses. She pulls the .38, shoots both enforcers before they reach their guns. Associates freeze. She says: "Tell Knuckles that Tommy's girl is coming." Walks out. Two dead wiseguys, witnesses left alive to spread message. Vegas mob world erupts—who is this girl? Body count: 2 (first mob kills). Running total: 3.

### Chapter 7: "Heat"

Torrino hears about the social club hit, doesn't believe it. Cocktail waitress killed Sal and Big Mike? Impossible. Frank Castellano warns him to take it seriously—she robbed the courier, knew where to hit them, this is planned. Torrino dismisses it, puts word out: find the girl, bring her in, slap her around, done. Meanwhile Kelly hits second target from Tommy's notebook—catches mob enforcer Ray "The Hammer" Kowalski alone at diner, shoots him four times in parking lot. Takes his .45 automatic and car keys. Leaves Tommy's dealer card on body. Message escalating. Body count: 1. Running total: 4.

### Chapter 8: "Point of No Return"

Kelly knows she can't stop now—they'll hunt her forever. Hits three more targets in 24 hours: bookmaker in his apartment, numbers runner at bar, loan shark at laundromat. All from Tommy's notebook, all part of the skim operation. Fast, brutal, efficient. Each kill she's learning—how to approach, when to shoot, how to escape. Takes weapons from each: spare .38, shotgun, ammunition. Final kill of the chapter: she drives stolen mob car straight through front window of Fremont casino restaurant where Torrino's crew eats breakfast. Jumps out, runs. Chaos. War officially declared. Body count: 3. Running total: 7.

## ACT 2: ESCALATION (Chapters 9-23)

### Chapter 9: "Hunted"

Torrino finally believes she's real threat. Calls emergency meeting, puts $25,000 contract on Kelly Morgan. Every soldier, enforcer, associate looking for her. Describes her: blonde cocktail waitress, 22, five-six, armed and dangerous. Problem: half of Vegas fits that description. Kelly holes up in Paradise Palms motel, watches news cover "gang violence" on Fremont Street. Knows she's got days before they find her. Plans next moves using Tommy's notebook—work up the ladder, kill them all. Body count: 0. Running total: 7.

### Chapter 10: "Kitchen Raid"

Kelly uses her Golden Nugget employee knowledge—enters through service corridor during shift change, employee uniform borrowed from Diane. Walks through kitchen to back offices where Frank Castellano counts receipts. Two guards outside door. She shoots first guard, second guard returns fire (misses), she puts two in his chest. Kicks door open—Castellano diving for desk gun. She's faster. Four rounds, he's dead. Takes his ledger (skim records). Exits through loading dock before security arrives. Castellano's death panics Torrino—his number two, his smartest guy, dead. Body count: 3. Running total: 10.

### Chapter 11: "The List"

Kelly in motel room, studying Castellano's ledger and Tommy's notes. Thirty-two names total in the organization—she's killed ten. Twenty-two remaining. Maps them out: enforcers, soldiers, associates, lieutenants, Torrino at top. Realizes she's doing this, really doing it. Brief moment of doubt—can she kill twenty-two more people? Remembers Tommy's face in morgue. Doubt evaporates. Cleans weapons, reloads, sleeps four hours. Wakes at 4am to hunt. Body count: 0. Running total: 10.

### Chapter 12: "Parking Garage"

Torrino's crew uses Golden Goose casino parking garage for meets. Kelly stakes it out, waits in stolen car. Eight guys show up for midnight meeting—discussing the "waitress problem." She ambushes from upper level: shotgun blast kills two instantly, .45 automatic for the rest. Firefight in concrete structure—ricochets, muzzle flashes, screaming. She's hit once (grazed ribs), keeps shooting. Drops six total before last two flee. Reloads, executes the wounded. Most bodies in single kill. Torrino loses eight soldiers in five minutes. Organization hemorrhaging. Body count: 6. Running total: 16.

### Chapter 13: "Wounded"

Kelly back at motel, treating gunshot graze—painful but superficial. First time she's been hit. Reality sinking in: they're shooting back now, she can die doing this. Doesn't change anything, just sharpens her. Binds ribs, swallows aspirin, plans next hit. Diane calls motel (Kelly gave her number for emergencies)—warns her Torrino's bringing in professional from LA, real killer, not street muscle. Kelly thanks her, hangs up. Knows clock's ticking. Body count: 0. Running total: 16.

### Chapter 14: "The Lieutenant's House"

Hits Johnny Battaglia, senior lieutenant, at his house 3am. Kicks door, shoots him in bed. His wife screaming—Kelly doesn't shoot her, just says: "He killed my boyfriend." Leaves wife alive, takes Battaglia's revolver and cash. Knows leaving witness is risk but won't kill civilians. Line she won't cross even now. Wife calls cops, first police involvement—Detective Barker investigates, finds mob execution, nobody cooperating. Closes it as "gang-related." Kelly's body count rising, law doesn't care. Body count: 1. Running total: 17.

### Chapter 15: "Midpoint - The Accountant"

Kelly needs intelligence on Torrino's location and schedule. Kidnaps Paulie "Numbers" Romano from his apartment—accountant who handles skim finances. Ties him up, threatens him (doesn't torture, just displays weapons convincingly). Paulie breaks immediately: tells her Torrino holds court every Thursday at social club, counts money, receives tribute. Security: six guards, reinforced door, escape route through basement. Paulie begs for life. She cuts him loose, tells him run to LA and never come back. He does. Kelly now has target and timeline: Thursday, four days away. Body count: 0. Running total: 17.

### Chapter 16: "The Soldier"

Kelly working through remaining names. Catches Vinnie Greco (soldier) at his girlfriend's apartment, shoots him through door when he answers. Girlfriend inside starts screaming. Kelly runs. Neighbors see her—blonde girl, jeans, running. Description circulating. She changes appearance: cuts hair short, dyes it brown, wears different clothes. Has to stay ahead of pattern recognition. Another kill: bookkeeper at his car, point-blank .38 to head. Efficient, cold, mechanical. She's not feeling these anymore—just checking names off list. Body count: 2. Running total: 19.

### Chapter 17: "The Professional Arrives"

Johnny Baxter flies in from LA—Vietnam vet, hitman, dead eyes. Torrino pays him $10,000 to find Kelly and end this. Baxter studies her pattern: kills from Tommy's notebook, working through organization systematically. She's got list, hitting names in order. He cross-references victims, predicts next targets. Sets trap. Meanwhile Kelly kills another soldier (caught at bar, shot in bathroom). Doesn't know professional's hunting her with actual skill. Running total: 20.

### Chapter 18: "The Bar"

Kelly hits Mickey Sullivan (enforcer) at Irish pub on Charleston. Walks in, shoots him at pool table, walks out. But Baxter's watching—he's been staking out predicted targets. Follows her at distance to motel. Doesn't strike yet—wants to confirm her patterns, room location, when she sleeps. Kelly doesn't spot tail (he's too good). She's tired, wounded, running on adrenaline and hatred. Sleeps with gun under pillow. Baxter watches from parking lot, planning his move. Body count: 1. Running total: 21.

### Chapter 19: "Motel Shootout"

4am, Baxter kicks in Kelly's motel door. She wakes instantly, rolls off bed as he opens fire—mattress explodes, rounds through wall. She returns fire blind, scrambles for bathroom. He advances tactical, professional. She's outmatched. He corners her—she throws shampoo bottle (desperate), he flinches, she lunges, they grapple. Brutal close-quarters fight, both trying to bring guns to bear. She bites his gun hand, he drops pistol, she shoots him three times with her .38. He dies shocked—killed by amateur cocktail waitress. Kelly escapes motel before cops arrive. Body count: 1. Running total: 22.

### Chapter 20: "Realization"

Kelly holes up in new location (abandoned warehouse), treating fresh wounds from Baxter fight. Bruised, cut, exhausted. Realizes she got lucky—professional almost killed her. Won't survive another. Counts remaining targets: ten left including Torrino. Thursday's meeting is her shot—hit them all at once, finish this. Either she wipes out leadership or dies trying. No middle ground left. Takes Baxter's M1 carbine (found in his car), adds to arsenal. Preparing for final assault. Body count: 0. Running total: 22.

### Chapter 21: "The Prep"

Kelly spends two days preparing: steals reliable car (Ford sedan), scouts social club building, maps escape routes, acquires more ammunition (pawn shops, criminal contacts, spending last of stolen money). Loads all weapons: .38 revolver, .45 automatic, shotgun, M1 carbine. Writes brief note explaining everything, leaves it in motel room with Tommy's notebook—if she dies, someone finds it, knows why. Calls Diane, thanks her, says goodbye without saying it. Sleeps deeply for first time in weeks—combat sleep, body preparing. Body count: 0. Running total: 22.

### Chapter 22: "Thursday Afternoon"

Kelly watches social club from across Fremont Street. Torrino's guys arriving—counting six guards outside, unknown number inside. Sees Torrino enter 6pm (early, establishing court). More associates arriving through evening. She waits in car, checking weapons compulsively. Thinking about Tommy, about her father, about Searchlight and how she ended up here. Not regret—just observation. She's 22, probably dying tonight, fine with it if she takes them with her. Sun sets, neon blazes. Time to move. Body count: 0. Running total: 22.

### Chapter 23: "Dark Moment"

Kelly moves to assault position (adjacent building rooftop). Watches through binoculars: Torrino holding court, eight guys inside, six outside. Fourteen total. She's got maybe thirty rounds total across all weapons. Math doesn't work. Even if she kills Torrino, won't get them all. Moment of despair—can't finish this, going to die incomplete. Then sees Torrino laughing at something, smoking cigar, casual and safe. Remembers Tommy's body. Decides: kill as many as possible, make sure Torrino's one of them. That's enough. Chamber round, move. Body count: 0. Running total: 22.

## ACT 3: RECKONING (Chapters 24-30)

### Chapter 24: "The Assault Begins"

10pm, Kelly approaches social club from alley. Kills first guard with knife (silent). Takes his shotgun. Second guard turns—she shoots him point-blank. Third guard drawing weapon—.45 rounds drop him. Alarm raised. Three outside guards rushing—she empties .45 into them, drops two, third wounded retreats inside screaming. Front door reinforced but side window accessible—she crashes through. Inside: chaos. Four guys scrambling for weapons, Torrino diving behind desk. Kelly opens up with M1 carbine. Bodies dropping. Firefight in close quarters. Body count: 6. Running total: 28.

### Chapter 25: "Interior Battle"

Gunfight in social club—Kelly behind overturned table, three soldiers returning fire from behind bar and doorway. Torrino escaped to basement (his exit route). She throws desk lamp (creates opening), rushes forward firing carbine, drops one soldier. Second soldier hits her (shoulder wound), she shoots him with .38. Third soldier charges—shotgun blast at five feet. Blood everywhere, ears ringing, wounded badly. Searches bodies for Torrino—gone. Basement door open. She reloads, follows. Body count: 3. Running total: 31.

### Chapter 26: "Basement Hunt"

Kelly descends into basement—wine storage, old bootlegger tunnels from 1940s. Torrino hiding somewhere in darkness, armed. She's bleeding from shoulder, vision swimming. Cat-and-mouse in underground. He fires from darkness—misses. She returns fire—also misses. Stalking each other through catacombs. Finally corners him in dead-end tunnel. He's got revolver, she's got .38. Both wounded, exhausted. Standoff in flashlight beams. He tries to negotiate: "You want money? I'll pay. You want out of Vegas? I'll arrange it." She shoots him twice. He doesn't die immediately. Body count: 1 (Torrino). Running total: 32.

### Chapter 27: "The Reckoning"

Torrino dying on tunnel floor. Kelly stands over him. He asks why—she says Tommy's name. Recognition flickers: "The dealer kid?" Admits he ordered the desert retirement, doesn't even remember it clearly—just another problem handled. Kelly shoots him again (head this time). He's dead. She stands there moment, waiting to feel something. Feels nothing. Empty. Climbs back upstairs through carnage, sirens approaching. Twelve dead bodies in social club and alley. She's hit twice, losing blood. Grabs Tommy's notebook from her jacket, leaves it on Torrino's desk—evidence. Escapes through alley as cops arrive. Body count: 0 (Torrino already counted). Running total: 32.

### Chapter 28: "Escape"

Kelly driving stolen Ford east on Boulder Highway, bleeding badly. Shoulder wound serious, needs medical attention. Can't go to hospital—cops will grab her. Heads for desert, toward Searchlight. Thinks about going to father's old place, dying there maybe. Vision blurring, pulling over at abandoned gas station. Wraps shoulder with torn shirt, stops bleeding enough. Knows she won't make Searchlight. Sits against station wall watching sunrise over desert. Tommy's avenged. That's all that matters. Passes out. Body count: 0. Running total: 32.

### Chapter 29: "The Reckoning - Aftermath"

Kelly wakes in clinic—backroom doctor, criminal friendly, Diane somehow found her. Been unconscious two days. Shoulder wound treated, will live. Diane tells her: Vegas is chaos. Torrino's organization collapsed, power vacuum, mob war brewing. Police investigating mass murder, no witnesses cooperating, case going nowhere. Kelly's description circulating but nobody's saying her name. Street legend starting: "The Waitress Who Killed Knuckles Torrino." Diane leaves cash on bedside table, tells her disappear. Kelly nods. Body count: 0. Running total: 32 (final).

### Chapter 30: "Neon Knights"

Week later. Kelly at bus station, short brown hair, sunglasses, heading to California with $800 and father's .38. Shoulder healing, scars forming. Watches Vegas recede through bus window—neon glittering in daylight, city that took everything. Tommy's still dead, she's still broken, but accounts settled. Thirty-two mob guys dead for one blackjack dealer. Mathematics of revenge. She doesn't feel cleansed or redeemed—just finished. Bus crosses state line. Kelly sleeps. Somewhere behind her, Vegas keeps eating its own. She's done feeding it. The end. Body count: 0. Final total: 32.
