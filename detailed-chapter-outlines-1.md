POV: Kelly Morgan, first person
Setting: Golden Nugget Casino floor and Kelly's apartment
Time: Friday evening into night, summer 1977

* **Purpose:** Establish Kelly's normal life and relationship with Tommy before tragedy strikes, showing what she'll lose.

* **Beats:**
  - Kelly works cocktail shift, observing casino floor and regulars—dealers, pit bosses, wiseguys who tip well and talk loud. She watches Tommy dealing blackjack, notes he's distracted tonight, nervous.
  - Break room encounter: Tommy's tense, says he needs to talk to her later. She's concerned but casino floor is busy—four more hours of serving drinks to drunk tourists and mob guys who call her sweetheart.
  - After shift they meet at apartment (off Charleston, small one-bedroom, cheap furniture). Tommy confesses he saw something at casino he shouldn't have, won't give details, asks if she thinks Gaming Commission would protect a witness.
  - Kelly warns him mob owns Gaming Commission, cops, judges—everyone. Tells him forget what he saw, they'll save money and leave Vegas like they planned. Tommy agrees reluctantly, says she's right. They go to bed.
  - Final beat: Kelly lying awake, Tommy sleeping beside her. She knows he won't let it go—he's too honest, too stupid-brave. Moment of dread she can't name.

* **Dialogue Topics:** Casino work gossip, Tommy's nervousness, Kelly warning him about mob power, Tommy's idealism about reporting crime, their escape plans for California, brief argument that ends in uneasy agreement.

* **Emotional Arc:** Kelly starts content in routine, shifts to concern when Tommy's acting strange, ends with unnamed dread that he's in danger but no idea how bad.

* **Key Details:** 1977 Vegas prices (drinks, wages), cocktail uniform description, apartment details (rotary phone, wood paneling, small TV), Tommy's dealer uniform, Kelly's working-class observational voice, establish she knows casino inside-out.

## Chapter 2: "The Witness"
Target Word Count: 1,733 words
POV: Tommy Delano, third person (only non-Kelly chapter)
Setting: Golden Nugget back offices and Tommy's apartment
Time: Three nights before Chapter 1, late evening

* **Purpose:** Show what Tommy witnessed and his fatal decision to report it, making his death meaningful and Kelly's revenge justified.

* **Beats:**
  - Tommy finishes blackjack shift, takes break in back corridor. Hears voices from counting room (normally locked). Door's cracked open—he sees Frank Castellano and two enforcers skimming cash from skim operation, dividing it up, discussing Torrino's cut.
  - Tommy watches for two minutes, memorizing faces and details. They don't see him. He leaves quietly, shaken. Knows he witnessed federal crime—casino skimming, mob operation. Goes home, can't sleep.
  - Next day Tommy starts documenting what he saw in dealer notebook—names, dates, amounts he estimated. Debates what to do. Knows reporting is dangerous but can't let it go. Decides to build case first, then approach Gaming Commission.
  - That evening Tommy tells Kelly he saw something (Chapter 1 conversation from his side). She warns him correctly. He says he'll drop it but already knows he won't.
  - Final beat: Tommy at casino next shift, Castellano watching him. Tommy realizes he's been made—they know he saw. Too late. Chapter ends with dread.

* **Dialogue Topics:** Tommy's internal debate about right thing to do, his conversation with Kelly (her warning), brief exchanges with other dealers about "the bosses," Tommy's naive belief in justice system.

* **Emotional Arc:** Tommy goes from shock at witnessing crime to moral conviction that he must report it, ending with realization he's already dead but can't undo it.

* **Key Details:** Counting room description (cash, ledgers, mob guys counting), Tommy's dealer notebook and handwriting, his basic decency contrasted with Kelly's practical cynicism, establish he's marked for death by chapter end.

## Chapter 3: "Desert Retirement"
Target Word Count: 1,733 words
POV: Kelly Morgan, first person
Setting: Golden Nugget, Kelly's apartment, Las Vegas morgue
Time: Three days after Chapter 1, day through evening

* **Purpose:** Tommy's murder discovered, Kelly's grief transitions immediately to cold rage and decision to act.

* **Beats:**
  - Kelly works double shift (Tommy didn't show for his shift, casino called her asking where he is). She's worried, calling hospitals between drink orders. No record of him anywhere. Other dealers avoiding her eyes.
  - Diane pulls Kelly aside after shift, says word on floor is Tommy witnessed skim operation and Torrino's people "handled it." Kelly doesn't believe her—Tommy wouldn't be that stupid. Goes home to empty apartment, panic rising.
  - Day three: Detective Barker calls. Body found in desert outside town, single gunshot back of head. Needs family to identify. Kelly (closest thing to family Tommy had) goes to county morgue.
  - Morgue scene: Kelly identifies Tommy's body on steel table. Entry wound back of head, exit wound destroyed his face. ME says execution-style, probably mob-related. Kelly stands there long time, something breaking and reforming inside her—grief calcifying into purpose.
  - Kelly returns to apartment, finds Tommy's dealer notebook in his things (he hid it). Reads his documentation of the skim—names, dates, amounts. Understands what happened and why. Decision made without words: she's going to kill everyone in this notebook.

* **Dialogue Topics:** Casino staff gossip and evasion, Diane's careful warning about mob involvement, Detective Barker's clinical questions, ME's professional assessment, Kelly's silent processing (minimal dialogue chapter—mostly action and observation).

* **Emotional Arc:** Kelly moves from worry to panic to grief to cold murderous purpose. The transformation happens at morgue—she doesn't cry or scream, just goes cold and starts planning.

* **Key Details:** County morgue atmosphere (fluorescent lights, chemical smell, steel tables), Tommy's body details, detective's notebook and routine questions, Tommy's dealer notebook as evidence/hitlist, Kelly's working-class stoicism—she doesn't perform grief.

## Chapter 4: "The Inheritance"
Target Word Count: 1,733 words
POV: Kelly Morgan, first person
Setting: Kelly's apartment and storage unit in industrial area
Time: Day after morgue identification, afternoon into evening

* **Purpose:** Kelly acquires weapons and commits to revenge path, transforming from waitress to armed vigilante.

* **Beats:**
  - Kelly at apartment packing Tommy's things, moving methodically through their shared life. Finds his documentation—notebook is detailed. He really was going to report them. Idiot. Brave idiot. She memorizes every name: Frank Castellano, Vincent Torrino, Ray Kowalski, eight others.
  - Kelly drives to storage unit where she keeps few possessions from Searchlight. Retrieves father's gun case—Smith & Wesson Model 10 .38 Special revolver, box of ammunition (50 rounds, old but good). Gun's been in storage six years since he died. She cleans it methodically, muscle memory from teenage years shooting jackrabbits.
  - Back at apartment, Kelly practices in bathroom mirror—draw, aim, dry-fire. Hands steady. Loads six rounds, practices reload with speedloader. Father's voice in her head: "Squeeze don't jerk, sight picture, follow through." It comes back natural.
  - Kelly makes list from Tommy's notebook: ten names directly involved in skim operation. Knows she can't go to police (they're paid off), can't go to Gaming Commission (mob-owned), can't go to FBI (take years, maybe nothing). Only option left is her and this gun.
  - Final beat: Kelly loads revolver, puts it in her purse, looks at herself in mirror. Still looks like cocktail waitress. Good. They won't see her coming.

* **Dialogue Topics:** None (internal monologue chapter), Kelly's thoughts about Tommy's documentation, her father's shooting lessons remembered, her tactical assessment of targets and approach.

* **Emotional Arc:** Kelly channels grief into methodical preparation. She's not emotional—she's cold, practical, accepting what she's about to become. Peace in committing to violence.

* **Key Details:** Storage unit (concrete, fluorescent lights, dusty boxes), father's gun case and revolver specifications, cleaning and maintenance details, practice routine, Tommy's notebook entries, Kelly's internal voice—flat, observational, working-class practical.

## Chapter 5: "The Courier"
Target Word Count: 1,733 words
POV: Kelly Morgan, first person
Setting: Golden Nugget parking lot and Paradise Palms motel
Time: Friday 2am, five days after Tommy's death

* **Purpose:** Kelly's first criminal act (robbery) provides war chest and announces her intentions to mob.

* **Beats:**
  - Kelly stakes out Golden Nugget service entrance, waiting in stolen car (took it from long-term airport parking). Knows from four years of casino work that mob courier runs cash to Torrino every Friday 2am—skim money, $40-60K typical. She's wearing black, face covered with scarf, gun loaded.
  - 2:17am: Courier exits (young guy, nervous type, carrying locked briefcase). Kelly follows him to his car in employee lot. Waits until he unlocks car door, then approaches fast—gun to his head through window. "Don't move, don't talk, give me the case."
  - Courier freezing, terrified. Unlocks briefcase with shaking hands, shows her the cash. She takes it, tells him: "Tell Vincent Torrino this is for Tommy Delano. Tell him his waitress is coming." Lets courier live—needs him to deliver message. He runs.
  - Kelly drives to Paradise Palms motel (cheap hourly place on Boulder Highway), rents room cash, counts money. Fifty thousand dollars in hundreds and fifties. More money than she's made in five years serving drinks. War chest established.
  - Final beat: Kelly uses phonebook to find pawn shops and gun dealers. Tomorrow she'll buy more weapons, more ammunition, everything she needs. The fifty thousand will fund her war. Sleeps with gun under pillow, dreamless.

* **Dialogue Topics:** Kelly's brief commands to courier, courier's terrified compliance, Kelly's message for Torrino, motel clerk's bored check-in questions, Kelly's internal planning about weapon purchases.

* **Emotional Arc:** Kelly's cold and methodical throughout—this is work, not emotion. Slight satisfaction delivering message through courier. Practical relief at having funds.

* **Key Details:** Casino service entrance and employee parking, courier's nervousness and mob-guy tells, locked briefcase and cash bundles, Paradise Palms motel atmosphere (neon, truckers, questions not asked), phonebook and weapon-shopping plans.

## Chapter 6: "First Blood"
Target Word Count: 1,733 words
POV: Kelly Morgan, first person
Setting: Lucky Seven Pawn Shop (Torrino's social club) on Fremont Street
Time: Tuesday afternoon, week after Tommy's death

* **Purpose:** Kelly's first kills announce her war and establish she's genuinely dangerous.

* **Beats:**
  - Kelly spent three days buying weapons from pawn shops and criminal contacts (using stolen money). Now armed: .38 revolver, backup snubnose, ammunition, knife. Wears jeans and work shirt, hair in ponytail, looks like broke local. Walks into Lucky Seven Pawn Shop mid-afternoon.
  - Front room: guitars, TVs, jewelry. Owner behind counter directs her to back room. She walks through beaded curtain—four mob guys playing cards (two enforcers she recognizes from Golden Nugget, two associates). They look up, annoyed. "We're closed, sweetheart."
  - Kelly asks for Vincent Torrino. They laugh—boss doesn't see cocktail waitresses. Big enforcer (Sal) stands up, starts toward her: "Get lost before—" Kelly pulls .38, shoots him twice in chest. Second enforcer (Big Mike) reaching for gun—she shoots him three times. Both down, dead or dying.
  - Two associates frozen, hands visible. Kelly aims at them: "Tell Knuckles that Tommy Delano's girl is coming for him. Tell him I'm going to kill everyone in his organization. Tell him now." Backs toward door, covering them. They don't move. She exits, walks calmly to car, drives away.
  - Aftermath: Kelly in motel room, hands shaking now (adrenaline crash). She killed two men. Feels nothing about it—they helped kill Tommy. Cleans gun, reloads, listens to police scanner. Social club shooting reported, no suspect description (associates not talking to cops). War officially started.

* **Dialogue Topics:** Kelly's brief questions, mob guys' dismissal and mockery, Kelly's message for Torrino, police scanner chatter, Kelly's internal assessment of her first kills.

* **Emotional Arc:** Kelly cold and focused during shooting, shaking afterward from adrenaline but not guilt. Satisfaction that message delivered. Acceptance that she's murderer now.

* **Key Details:** Pawn shop layout (legitimate front, back room club), card game and mob guys' casual security, gun calibers and shot placement, Kelly's escape discipline, motel room police scanner and news coverage, Vegas mob world reacting.

## Chapter 7: "Heat"
Target Word Count: 1,733 words
POV: Kelly Morgan, first person (with Torrino scenes in third person for perspective)
Setting: Torrino's office and various Vegas locations
Time: Day after social club shooting

* **Purpose:** Show mob's initial dismissal of Kelly as threat, then escalating realization as she hits again.

* **Beats:**
  - Torrino's office: He's hearing about social club shooting from associates. Doesn't believe cocktail waitress killed Sal and Big Mike—impossible. Maybe boyfriend's family, maybe rival crew. Frank Castellano warns him to take it seriously: girl robbed courier, knew when and where to hit, left message. Torrino dismisses it: "Find the girl, slap her around, problem solved."
  - Kelly's perspective: She's already hunting next target. Ray "The Hammer" Kowalski—enforcer on Tommy's list, one of the guys who probably dumped Tommy in desert. Knows he eats breakfast at same diner (Palace Café) every morning. She stakes it out before dawn.
  - 6:30am: Kowalski exits diner, walking to car alone. Kelly approaches from behind in parking lot: "Ray Kowalski?" He turns, reaching for gun—she shoots him four times center mass. Big man takes time to drop. She takes his .45 automatic and car keys, leaves Tommy's Golden Nugget dealer card on body. Message.
  - Police investigation: Detective Barker at scene, recognizes mob hit. No witnesses cooperating. Finds dealer card, doesn't know what it means yet but bags it as evidence. Starting to see pattern—three mob guys dead in two days.
  - Kelly driving Kowalski's stolen car to new motel, switching locations constantly. Examines .45 automatic—more stopping power than .38 but heavier recoil. Practices in motel room, getting feel for it. Body count: three. Twenty-nine names remaining on her list.

* **Dialogue Topics:** Torrino's dismissal and orders, Castellano's warnings, Kowalski's last words (brief), Detective Barker's questions to non-cooperating witnesses, Kelly's internal tactical assessments.

* **Emotional Arc:** Kelly coldly methodical, treating kills like work shifts. Slight satisfaction at Kowalski (he dumped Tommy). Torrino moving from dismissive to annoyed.

* **Key Details:** Torrino's office (cigar smoke, venetian blinds, spittoon), Palace Café parking lot at dawn, .45 automatic specifications, dealer card as signature, Detective Barker's growing pattern recognition, weapon acquisition from kills.

## Chapter 8: "Point of No Return"
Target Word Count: 1,733 words
POV: Kelly Morgan, first person
Setting: Multiple Vegas locations—apartments, bars, laundromat, Fremont casino
Time: 48-hour montage, 10 days after Tommy's death

* **Purpose:** Kelly's rapid escalation and spectacular car-crash statement eliminates any chance of retreat.

* **Beats:**
  - Kelly hits three targets in 24 hours, working through Tommy's list methodically. First: bookmaker in his apartment (caught him sleeping, two rounds). Second: numbers runner at downtown bar (shot in bathroom). Third: loan shark at laundromat (public killing, witnesses scatter). Each kill she takes weapons and cash. Building arsenal: two .38s, .45 automatic, shotgun, over 100 rounds mixed ammunition.
  - With each kill Kelly's learning: how to approach without raising alarm, when to shoot (always first), how to escape in chaos. She's getting better at this, more efficient. Notes her own improvement clinically—surviving means learning fast.
  - Kelly knows she can't stop now. Even if she wanted to (she doesn't), mob won't let her live. Only way out is through—kill them all or die trying. Accepts this completely. Freedom in having no options.
  - Final escalation: Kelly steals mob car (recognizes it from Torrino's guys), loads it with stolen construction materials (makes it heavy battering ram). Drives it through front window of Fremont casino restaurant at 2pm—mob crew eating lunch inside. Crashes through glass, tables exploding, men diving away. Kelly jumps out, runs through service corridor (knows casino layout perfectly), escapes before security responds.
  - Aftermath: Kelly watches news at motel—"gang violence escalates on Fremont Street," police investigating. Torrino must know she's real threat now. War fully declared. She cleans weapons, plans next moves. Body count: seven. No going back.

* **Dialogue Topics:** Brief exchanges during kills (victims' last words), news coverage, Kelly's internal commentary on her improving technique, her acceptance of death as likely outcome.

* **Emotional Arc:** Kelly moving from cold purpose to almost mechanical efficiency. Emotional shutdown complete—she's weapon now, not person. Brief thrill at car crash (spectacular violence feels right).

* **Key Details:** Multiple locations rapid-fire, weapon details and acquisitions, Kelly's tactical learning curve, casino restaurant crash (glass, chaos, mob guys diving), news coverage of "gang war," body count tracking.

## Chapter 9: "Hunted"
Target Word Count: 1,733 words
POV: Kelly Morgan, first person (with Torrino meeting in third person)
Setting: Torrino's emergency meeting and Kelly's motel hideout
Time: Day after car crash, late evening

* **Purpose:** Establish mob's full-scale hunt for Kelly and her strategic response—go to ground temporarily.

* **Beats:**
  - Torrino calls emergency meeting of all remaining crew—20+ guys crowded into social club back room. He's finally taking this seriously. Announces $25,000 contract on Kelly Morgan: blonde cocktail waitress, 22, five-six, armed and extremely dangerous. Every soldier, enforcer, associate is hunting her. Castellano assigns teams to check motels, casinos, bars, anywhere she might surface.
  - Kelly's watching news in Paradise Palms motel—coverage of Fremont Street violence, police statement about "organized crime conflict." Her name hasn't been released but she knows they're hunting her. Every mob guy in Vegas has her description now. Advantage of surprise gone.
  - Kelly assesses situation: seven dead, 25 remaining on her list including Torrino. She can't keep hitting them the same way—they're ready now. Needs new approach. Studies Tommy's notebook and stolen ledgers, looking for patterns. Where do they feel safe? When are they vulnerable?
  - Realizes she has one remaining advantage: they think she's acting emotionally (crazy revenge girl). But she's not—she's methodical. They'll expect her to hide. Instead she'll escalate. Hit them where they gather, take out multiple targets at once. Higher risk but more efficient.
  - Kelly dyes hair dark brown, cuts it short. Changes appearance. Buys different clothes (less memorable). Practices with all weapons—.38, .45, shotgun. She's got maybe week before they find her. Needs to kill as many as possible before then. Plans next attack: ambush their meeting spots, use casino knowledge against them.

* **Dialogue Topics:** Torrino's contract announcement and orders, mob guys discussing search strategy, news anchor's reporting, Kelly's internal tactical analysis and planning.

* **Emotional Arc:** Kelly completely calm despite being hunted by entire mob. Views it as tactical problem to solve. Satisfaction in knowing she's got them scared enough to put contract on her.

* **Key Details:** Social club meeting atmosphere (angry mob guys, Torrino's orders), $25K contract details, motel room planning session, hair dye and appearance change process, weapon inventory and maintenance, Tommy's notebook cross-referenced with patterns.

## Chapter 10: "Kitchen Raid"
Target Word Count: 1,733 words
POV: Kelly Morgan, first person
Setting: Golden Nugget casino kitchen and back offices
Time: Three days later, evening shift

* **Purpose:** Kelly eliminates Torrino's number two (Castellano) using insider casino knowledge, proving she's still hunting despite manhunt.

* **Beats:**
  - Kelly borrows Golden Nugget cocktail uniform from Diane (head waitress helping her quietly). During shift change chaos (5pm), Kelly enters through employee entrance wearing uniform, hair covered. Blends perfectly—nobody questions cocktail waitress in uniform during shift change. She knows this casino better than security does.
  - Navigates through kitchen during dinner rush—cooks, dishwashers, servers moving frantically. Nobody looks at her. Kelly reaches back corridor leading to offices where Castellano counts daily skim receipts. Two guards outside his door—young guys, not expecting trouble in casino heart.
  - Kelly approaches guards like she's delivering message. Gets within three feet, pulls .38: shoots first guard twice (head, chest), second guard reaching for gun—shoots him three times. Both down in seconds. Kicks open Castellano's door.
  - Castellano behind desk, diving for drawer gun. Kelly fires four rounds—hits him three times. He crashes back in chair, gasping. She takes his ledger (skim records, more names and addresses), checks he's dead. Entire sequence under 30 seconds.
  - Escape: Kelly walks back through kitchen chaos (gunshots heard but nobody knows where from), exits through loading dock. Removes uniform, underneath wearing street clothes. Drives away in anonymous car. News later: Frank Castellano murdered at Golden Nugget, two guards dead, no suspect. Torrino panicking—his smartest guy, killed in "secure" location.

* **Dialogue Topics:** Brief kitchen worker exchanges, Kelly's commands to guards ("Don't move"), Castellano's last gasps, Kelly's internal timing and navigation notes.

* **Emotional Arc:** Kelly cold and focused, treating infiltration like work shift. Satisfaction at Castellano (he ran the skim, ordered Tommy's death). No hesitation, no mercy.

* **Key Details:** Shift change chaos, uniform as camouflage, kitchen layout and restaurant noise covering gunshots, back corridor security, Castellano's office (desk, ledgers, safe), ledger contents, loading dock escape route, body count: ten total.

## Chapter 11: "The List"
Target Word Count: 1,733 words
POV: Kelly Morgan, first person
Setting: New motel room (Oasis Motor Lodge, different location)
Time: Late night after Castellano killing

* **Purpose:** Kelly takes stock of campaign progress and commits to seeing it through despite mounting danger.

* **Beats:**
  - Kelly in motel room, doors locked, chair wedged under handle. Spreads out Tommy's notebook and Castellano's stolen ledger on bed. Cross-references names—original list of 32 mob guys involved in skim operation. She's killed ten. Twenty-two remaining plus Torrino makes twenty-three total.
  - Maps them out on notepad: enforcers (muscle, 8 remaining), soldiers (mid-level, 9 remaining), lieutenants (3 remaining), Torrino at top. Castellano was lieutenant—big hit. Remaining lieutenants: Johnny Battaglia (runs south side), Vinnie Scarlatti (runs casinos), Mickey Sullivan (runs enforcement). Kill them, organization collapses.
  - Kelly realizes scale of what she's attempting. Twenty-three more people to kill. Even if she gets one per day (impossible pace), that's three weeks. They'll find her before then. Math doesn't work. Needs to think bigger—multiple targets at once, hit their gathering points.
  - Brief moment of doubt: Can she really kill twenty-three more people? Sees Tommy's face in her mind—not romantic memory, just his body on morgue table, exit wound, execution style. Doubt evaporates. She'll kill them all or die trying. Either way, they pay.
  - Kelly cleans all weapons, inventories ammunition (getting low—needs to acquire more), plans next hits. Focuses on lieutenants first—remove leadership, organization panics. Checks police scanner: cops investigating Castellano hit, no leads. She sleeps four hours, wakes before dawn. Time to hunt.

* **Dialogue Topics:** None (internal monologue chapter), Kelly's tactical analysis, her mental math about timeline and odds, memory of Tommy as motivation, ammunition concerns.

* **Emotional Arc:** Kelly experiences brief doubt, then renewed cold determination. Accepts probable death but commits to maximum damage before that. Peace in clarity of purpose.

* **Key Details:** Motel security measures, spreadsheet of targets and hierarchy, organizational chart of mob structure, ammunition inventory (running low), weapon maintenance routine, police scanner chatter, Kelly's working-class accounting mindset applied to murder.

## Chapter 12: "Parking Garage"
Target Word Count: 1,733 words
POV: Kelly Morgan, first person
Setting: Golden Goose casino parking garage
Time: Midnight, two days after Castellano killing

* **Purpose:** Kelly's most spectacular multi-kill ambush demonstrates her escalating danger and results in her first wound.

* **Beats:**
  - Kelly stakes out Golden Goose casino from stolen car. Knows from years of observation that Torrino's crew uses parking garage for "secure" meetings—not casino floor (cameras), not social club (too exposed after her hit). Garage is underground, low lighting, minimal security. Tonight: big meeting about "the waitress problem."
  - Midnight: Eight mob guys arrive in three cars, park on lower level. Kelly's positioned on upper level ramp with stolen shotgun and .45 automatic. Watches them gather near cars—discussing strategy, arguing about who's hunting her, Torrino's orders. She waits until they're grouped.
  - Kelly opens fire from 20 feet up: shotgun blast kills two instantly (buckshot at close range devastating). Remaining six scattering, drawing weapons. She drops shotgun, pulls .45, starts shooting methodically. Concrete garage amplifies gunfire—deafening. Muzzle flashes strobing. She hits three more, dropping them.
  - Remaining three returning fire—rounds hitting concrete near her, ricochets sparking. One round grazes her ribs (first time she's been hit). Pain sharp but adrenaline overrides it. She keeps shooting, empties .45 magazine. Drops two more. Last surviving mob guy running for exit—she lets him go (out of ammunition, needs to reload).
  - Kelly checks her wound—bloody but superficial, rib graze. Walks to bodies, executes two still-breathing wounded (reloaded .38). Takes their weapons and ammunition. Six dead, one wounded fled. Exits garage before police arrive. Driving away, ribs burning, she's shaking from adrenaline and shock. First time she's bled. Doesn't change anything.

* **Dialogue Topics:** Mob guys' overheard meeting discussion, Kelly's internal tactical commands ("wait... now... keep shooting"), brief exchanges between mob guys during firefight ("Where is she?!" "Up there!"), Kelly's pain assessment.

* **Emotional Arc:** Kelly cold during ambush (mechanical efficiency), shock when hit (first wound), shaking afterward (adrenaline crash), then grim satisfaction at six kills despite injury.

* **Key Details:** Parking garage layout (levels, lighting, concrete echoes), shotgun and .45 specifications, muzzle flash and ricochet details, rib graze wound (bloody but superficial), weapon and ammunition acquisition from bodies, body count: sixteen total.

## Chapter 13: "Wounded"
Target Word Count: 1,733 words
POV: Kelly Morgan, first person
Setting: Oasis Motor Lodge motel room
Time: 3am after parking garage shootout

* **Purpose:** Kelly treats her wound and receives warning about professional hitman, raising stakes significantly.

* **Beats:**
  - Kelly in motel bathroom, stripping off bloody shirt. Rib graze wound—bullet carved groove along ribcage, didn't penetrate. Painful, bleeding freely, but not life-threatening. She cleans it with whiskey (screaming into towel), bandages with gauze and tape from first aid kit. Binds ribs tight, swallows handful of aspirin.
  - Reality settling in: they shot her. First time she's been hit. Could've been heart, lung, head. She got lucky. Pain radiating through torso with every breath—won't be able to move easily for days. Knows this slows her down when speed is survival.
  - Kelly examines weapons taken from garage: two more .38 revolvers, one 9mm automatic, extra ammunition. Building arsenal from her kills. Ironic—every mob guy she kills arms her better. She cleans and loads all weapons, arranges them for quick access.
  - Phone rings (motel room line): Diane calling. Warning her that word on casino floor is Torrino's bringing in professional from Los Angeles—real killer, not street muscle. Vietnam vet, done hits across west coast. "Kelly, these guys don't miss. You need to leave Vegas." Kelly thanks her, hangs up. She's not leaving.
  - Kelly lies on bed, ribs throbbing, guns within reach. Professional coming for her changes nothing—she's not stopping until Torrino's dead. Accepts she'll probably die soon. Wonders briefly if Tommy would want this (her death for his revenge). Decides he doesn't get a vote—this is for her now. Sleeps fitfully, gun under pillow.

* **Dialogue Topics:** Kelly's pain management self-talk, Diane's warning phone call about professional hitman, Kelly's internal debate about continuing versus fleeing, her redefinition of motivation (from Tommy's revenge to her own purpose).

* **Emotional Arc:** Kelly experiences physical shock and pain, brief consideration of mortality, then harder resolve. She's committed beyond death now—this is personal in different way.

* **Key Details:** Bathroom wound treatment (whiskey, gauze, tape, aspirin), rib graze medical accuracy, weapon inventory and maintenance, motel room phone call, professional hitman warning, Kelly's acceptance of probable death, body count unchanged: sixteen total.

## Chapter 14: "The Lieutenant's House"
Target Word Count: 1,733 words
POV: Kelly Morgan, first person
Setting: Johnny Battaglia's house in Henderson suburbs
Time: 3am, two days after wound (still healing)

* **Purpose:** Kelly eliminates first lieutenant and crosses moral line by killing in front of civilian witness.

* **Beats:**
  - Kelly stakes out Johnny Battaglia's house (lieutenant, runs south side operations). Quiet suburb, normal house, normal neighborhood. Battaglia lives with wife, two kids (teenagers, Kelly researched them). She waits until 3am—family asleep, Battaglia home from late casino meeting.
  - Kelly picks back door lock (learned from criminal contacts during weapon-buying), enters silently. Gun drawn, moving through dark house. Finds master bedroom, Battaglia snoring in bed, wife beside him. Kelly approaches bedside, aims .38 at his head.
  - Wife wakes up, sees Kelly with gun, starts screaming. Kelly shoots Battaglia three times before he wakes—head, chest. He dies in bed. Wife screaming hysterically, reaching for phone. Kelly doesn't shoot her—civilian, not involved. Says only: "He killed my boyfriend." Leaves wife alive, traumatized but unharmed.
  - Kelly searches house fast (wife still screaming)—finds Battaglia's safe in closet, takes cash ($8,000) and revolver. Exits through back door, gone before police arrive. Knows leaving witness is huge risk but can't kill civilians. That's her line—mob guys die, everyone else lives.
  - Aftermath: Kelly in car, shaking from adrenaline and moral complexity. Wife will describe her to police, give detailed description. First real witness. Detective Barker will have actual lead now. Kelly knows this complicates everything but won't regret it—she's killing guilty people, not innocents. Body count: seventeen total.

* **Dialogue Topics:** Kelly's brief statement to wife ("He killed my boyfriend"), wife's screams and pleas, Kelly's internal debate about civilian witnesses, police scanner coverage of Henderson home invasion and murder.

* **Emotional Arc:** Kelly cold during approach and killing, slight hesitation with witness, firm resolve not to kill civilian, shaking afterward from moral complexity she didn't expect to feel.

* **Key Details:** Henderson suburban home (normal, contrast with mob violence), bedroom invasion, wife as witness, Kelly's moral line about civilians, safe contents and acquisition, police scanner report with witness description, Detective Barker finally getting lead.

## Chapter 15: "Midpoint - The Accountant"
Target Word Count: 1,733 words
POV: Kelly Morgan, first person
Setting: Paulie Romano's apartment and Vegas streets
Time: Evening, 18 days after Tommy's death

* **Purpose:** Kelly acquires critical intelligence about Torrino's schedule and location through intimidation, enabling final assault planning.

* **Beats:**
  - Kelly needs intelligence—where is Torrino? He's gone to ground after seventeen mob guys killed. Realizes she needs accountant (Paulie "Numbers" Romano from stolen ledgers). He handles money, knows schedules, meets Torrino regularly. Not a killer—just numbers guy, probably terrified.
  - Kelly stakes out Paulie's apartment (anonymous complex off Sahara). Watches him come home from casino, nervous little man checking over shoulder constantly. She follows him inside, picks his apartment lock, waits in dark living room. He enters, flips light—sees her sitting in his chair, gun on lap.
  - Paulie freezing, hands up. Kelly: "Sit down, Paulie. Answer questions, you live. Lie, you die. Where's Torrino?" Paulie stammering, terrified. She doesn't threaten violence—just displays weapons calmly (several guns arranged on coffee table). Message clear: she's killed seventeen guys, she'll kill him.
  - Paulie breaks completely, tells her everything: Torrino holds court every Thursday 8pm at social club (regular schedule, never changes). Security: six guards outside, usually four guys inside with him. Reinforced front door, escape route through basement tunnels. Torrino paranoid but routine-bound—always Thursday, always same location.
  - Kelly cuts Paulie loose, tells him run to LA and never come back. He grabs jacket, runs. She lets him go—got what she needed. Now she knows: Thursday night, social club, ten guys including Torrino. One week to plan assault. This is her shot at ending it.

* **Dialogue Topics:** Kelly's questions, Paulie's terrified confessions, details about Torrino's security and schedule, Kelly's promise to let Paulie live if he talks, Paulie's begging and eventual flight.

* **Emotional Arc:** Kelly utterly cold and controlled (interrogation mode), satisfaction at acquiring intelligence, calculating resolve about coming assault. This is midpoint—she now has path to Torrino.

* **Key Details:** Paulie's apartment (bachelor pad, ledgers everywhere, nervous accountant's space), intimidation technique (displayed weapons, calm threats), Thursday meeting intelligence, security details, basement escape route, Kelly's target acquisition, body count unchanged: seventeen total.
