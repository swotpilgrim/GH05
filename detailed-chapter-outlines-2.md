# DETAILED CHAPTER OUTLINES: NEON KNIGHTS (Part 2)

## Chapter 16: "The Soldier"
Target Word Count: 1,733 words
POV: Kelly Morgan, first person
Setting: Various Vegas locations—apartment, parking lot
Time: Three days after Paulie interrogation, afternoon and evening

* **Purpose:** Kelly continues systematic elimination of targets while changing appearance to evade pattern recognition.

* **Beats:**
  - Kelly working through remaining soldier-level names from lists. Targets Vinnie Greco (soldier, runs protection rackets). Stakes out his girlfriend's apartment on east side. Waits in hallway wearing maintenance worker coveralls (disguise). Greco arrives 6pm, buzzed in by girlfriend.
  - Kelly knocks on apartment door. Greco opens it, sees woman's face—moment of confusion. She shoots him three times through doorway. He falls back into apartment. Girlfriend inside screaming. Kelly runs down stairs, exits building. Neighbors saw her (blonde woman in coveralls), description circulating.
  - Kelly realizes pattern recognition is problem—witnesses describing her, composite forming. Goes to drug store, buys hair dye (dark brown) and scissors. In motel bathroom cuts hair short (shoulder-length to chin-length bob), dyes it brown. Looks at different person in mirror. Necessary adaptation.
  - Second kill same evening: bookkeeper (Marco Benedetti) leaving casino accounting office. Kelly follows to parking lot, waits by his car. When he approaches, she shoots him point-blank in head with .38. Takes his wallet and keys. Fast, efficient, no witnesses this time.
  - Kelly in car, checking off names. Nineteen dead, fourteen remaining. Professional hitman still out there somewhere, hasn't found her yet. She's changing motels every two days, changing appearance, staying unpredictable. But clock's ticking—they'll find her eventually.

* **Dialogue Topics:** Brief exchange at door before Greco shooting, girlfriend's screams, Kelly's internal assessment of pattern recognition problem, self-instruction during appearance change.

* **Emotional Arc:** Kelly methodical and mechanical—killing is routine now. Practical concern about witnesses, no emotional response to changing appearance. She's fully weaponized, identity subordinated to mission.

* **Key Details:** Maintenance coverall disguise, apartment hallway shooting, witness descriptions circulating, hair cutting and dyeing process, parking lot execution, wallet/key acquisition, body count: nineteen total.

## Chapter 17: "The Professional Arrives"
Target Word Count: 1,733 words
POV: Johnny Baxter, third person (switching to show hunter's perspective)
Setting: Las Vegas airport and various stakeout locations
Time: Day after Kelly's appearance change

* **Purpose:** Introduce professional hitman threat and show competent adversary hunting Kelly through actual detective work.

* **Beats:**
  - Johnny Baxter arrives McCarran Airport from LA—35 years old, wiry build, dead eyes, Vietnam vet. Torrino's paying him $10,000 to find and kill cocktail waitress. Baxter's professional: no emotion, no ego, just problem-solving. Picks up rental car, checks into anonymous motel, begins research.
  - Baxter studies pattern: nineteen dead mob guys, all from same organization, all connected to casino skim operation. Killer has list (obvious from target selection), working through it systematically. He examines crime scenes through police reports (Torrino provides contacts), looking for method, mistakes, pattern.
  - Realizes killer isn't emotional revenge—she's methodical. Hits targets from list in rough order, uses different locations, different times. But pattern exists: she knows Vegas intimately (casino worker knowledge), knows targets' routines (surveillance), kills efficiently (trained or learning fast). Baxter cross-references victims, finds Tommy Delano connection.
  - Baxter pulls Tommy's case file—girlfriend was Kelly Morgan, 22, cocktail waitress at Golden Nugget. Gets her photo from employee records (matches witness descriptions despite hair change). He's got target ID now. Predicts next victims from organizational chart—remaining soldiers and lieutenants. Sets surveillance on likely targets.
  - Baxter stakes out Mickey Sullivan (enforcer, likely next target). Professional patience—he'll wait for her to show, then follow her to ground. Unlike mob guys hunting emotionally, Baxter's hunting tactically. Kelly doesn't know he exists yet.

* **Dialogue Topics:** Baxter's brief professional exchanges with Torrino, his internal tactical analysis (shown through observations), conversations with police contacts, minimal dialogue (he's quiet professional).

* **Emotional Arc:** Baxter completely emotionless—this is job, target is problem to solve. No anger at mob guys dying, no sympathy for Kelly. Pure professional detachment.

* **Key Details:** McCarran Airport 1977, Baxter's Vietnam background and professional hitman profile, crime scene analysis methodology, Tommy Delano connection discovery, Kelly Morgan ID from employee photo, organizational chart target prediction, body count unchanged: nineteen total.

## Chapter 18: "The Bar"
Target Word Count: 1,733 words
POV: Kelly Morgan, first person
Setting: Irish pub on Charleston Boulevard
Time: Evening, 22 days after Tommy's death

* **Purpose:** Kelly eliminates another target while unknowingly being tracked by Baxter, setting up their confrontation.

* **Beats:**
  - Kelly targeting Mickey Sullivan (enforcer, handles Torrino's muscle work). Knows he drinks at same Irish pub (Flanagan's) every night 8-10pm. She stakes it out from across street, watching through window. Sullivan at bar with two associates, drinking Jameson, loud and comfortable.
  - Kelly enters pub wearing different clothes (dark jacket, jeans, hair still brown and short). Walks to bar, orders beer, positions herself near pool tables. Associates leave around 9pm—Sullivan alone at bar now, drunk and vulnerable. She approaches.
  - Sullivan doesn't recognize her (appearance change worked). She asks for cigarette light. He obliges, flirting. She shoots him twice in chest at point-blank range, once in head. He falls off barstool. Bar explodes in chaos—people screaming, running. Kelly walks out front door calmly, gets in car, drives away.
  - What Kelly doesn't see: Baxter watching from car across street. He's been staking Sullivan out, waiting for her. Sees her enter, recognizes her despite changes (professional eye for targets). Watches shooting, watches her exit. Doesn't intervene—wants to follow her to her base, kill her when she's secure and off-guard.
  - Baxter follows Kelly's car at distance through Vegas streets. She's cautious but not paranoid—checks mirrors occasionally, doesn't spot professional tail. She pulls into Stardust Motel on Boulder Highway. Baxter watches her enter room 14, waits in parking lot. He's got her location now. Will hit her pre-dawn when humans sleep deepest.

* **Dialogue Topics:** Sullivan's brief flirtation, bar crowd's chaos and screaming, Kelly's internal satisfaction at another name crossed off, Baxter's silent observation and tactical planning (shown through his perspective in latter half).

* **Emotional Arc:** Kelly cold and efficient (routine kill), slight satisfaction at Sullivan (enforcer who hurt people). Baxter calculating and patient (predator closing on prey). Neither knows how close they are to confrontation.

* **Key Details:** Irish pub atmosphere (wood paneling, Jameson, pool tables), point-blank shooting, crowd chaos as cover, appearance change effectiveness, Baxter's professional surveillance technique, Stardust Motel location, body count: twenty total.

## Chapter 19: "Motel Shootout"
Target Word Count: 1,733 words
POV: Kelly Morgan, first person
Setting: Stardust Motel room
Time: 4am, same night as bar shooting

* **Purpose:** Kelly's closest brush with death against professional opponent, won through desperation and luck.

* **Beats:**
  - Kelly asleep in motel room, gun under pillow (always). 4:17am: door explodes inward (Baxter kicked it). Kelly wakes instantly, rolls off bed as gunfire erupts. Rounds ripping through mattress, wall behind bed. She hits floor, grabbing .38, scrambling for bathroom.
  - Baxter advances tactical—professional room clearing, controlled fire. Kelly blind-firing around doorframe (suppressing him), crawling into bathroom. He's better than her, trained, methodical. She's trapped in small bathroom, him between her and exit. Knows she's going to die here.
  - Baxter approaches bathroom, firing through wall (9mm rounds punching drywall). Kelly hit with debris, deafened by gunfire in enclosed space. In desperation she throws shampoo bottle at doorway—stupid move but he flinches (instinct). She lunges out, tackles him low.
  - Brutal close-quarters fight on motel room floor—both trying to bring guns to bear. He's stronger, trained. She's desperate, fights dirty. Bites his gun hand hard, drawing blood. He drops 9mm pistol, reaching for backup. She shoots him three times with .38 (chest, stomach, neck). He dies shocked—killed by amateur.
  - Kelly scrambling up, grabbing weapons and bag, running for car. Neighbors awake, lights coming on. Sirens distant but approaching. She drives away as police arrive. In car she's shaking violently—closest to death yet. Realizes that was professional (better than her, almost killed her). Won't survive another. Needs to end this soon or she's dead.

* **Dialogue Topics:** Minimal (gunfight chaos)—Kelly's internal panic and tactical commands to herself, Baxter's professional silence, Kelly's shock and realization afterward.

* **Emotional Arc:** Kelly jolted from sleep into pure survival terror, desperate fight-or-flight, shocked relief at survival, then grim realization she got lucky and luck runs out.

* **Key Details:** Door-kick entry, mattress and wall gunfire, bathroom trapped fighting position, shampoo bottle desperation throw, close-quarters grappling, bite attack, Baxter's death, police response timing, body count: twenty-one total.

## Chapter 20: "Realization"
Target Word Count: 1,733 words
POV: Kelly Morgan, first person
Setting: Abandoned warehouse in industrial area
Time: Dawn after Baxter fight, continuing through day

* **Purpose:** Kelly accepts that incremental approach will get her killed and commits to all-or-nothing final assault.

* **Beats:**
  - Kelly holes up in abandoned warehouse she scouted weeks ago (emergency backup location). Treating wounds from fight—bruises, cuts, one bullet graze on arm from Baxter's shooting. Nothing serious but accumulating damage. She's exhausted, running on fumes, knows she can't sustain this pace.
  - Kelly examines Baxter's weapons (taken from motel): 9mm Beretta, backup .38, M1 carbine in his car trunk (Vietnam bring-back). Professional kit. Realizes he was actually good—better than mob muscle, better than her. She survived through luck (shampoo bottle throw, desperate bite). Next professional won't make same mistakes.
  - Counts remaining targets: eleven mob guys plus Torrino equals twelve. If she keeps hitting them one-by-one, they'll find her first (send another professional, get lucky, corner her). Math doesn't work. Only option: hit them all at once. Thursday meeting at social club—Paulie said Torrino and most remaining guys gather weekly.
  - Kelly plans final assault: Thursday night (two days away), social club, multiple targets. She'll need all weapons, all ammunition. Either wipes out leadership in single strike or dies trying. No middle ground. Accepts death as likely outcome but fine with it if she takes Torrino with her. That's victory enough.
  - Spends day preparing: cleans all weapons, inventories ammunition (73 rounds mixed calibers—not enough but all she has), maps assault route, identifies escape paths (won't need them—suicide mission essentially). Writes brief note explaining everything, Tommy's story, leaves it with his notebook. If she dies, someone finds it someday. Legacy of sorts.

* **Dialogue Topics:** None (internal monologue), Kelly's tactical analysis and acceptance of death, her planning process, brief mental conversation with dead Tommy (apologizing for dying maybe, or thanking him for giving her purpose).

* **Emotional Arc:** Kelly moves from exhausted fear through analytical acceptance to calm resolve. She's choosing death on her terms—final assault is suicide mission but accomplishes goal. Peace in decision.

* **Key Details:** Abandoned warehouse hideout, wound treatment, Baxter's weapon inventory (particularly M1 carbine), ammunition count and shortage, Thursday planning, social club assault mapping, written note and Tommy's notebook, body count unchanged: twenty-one total.

## Chapter 21: "The Prep"
Target Word Count: 1,733 words
POV: Kelly Morgan, first person
Setting: Various Vegas locations—pawn shops, social club reconnaissance, stolen car lot
Time: Two days before Thursday assault

* **Purpose:** Kelly's methodical preparation for final assault, acquiring resources and saying silent goodbyes.

* **Beats:**
  - Kelly steals reliable car (1974 Ford Galaxie from long-term parking, reports won't happen for days). Needs dependable transport for assault. Checks it mechanically, fills tank, parks it near social club for quick access. Escape vehicle she probably won't use.
  - Acquires more ammunition using last of stolen money: visits three pawn shops, buys mixed calibers (.38, .45, 9mm, .30 carbine). Total ammunition now: 140 rounds across four weapons. Loads magazines, speedloaders, pockets. Enough for sustained firefight if she's accurate.
  - Kelly scouts social club building in daylight (Wednesday afternoon). Lucky Seven Pawn Shop on Fremont, two-story brick, reinforced front door, barred windows. She maps surroundings: adjacent alley (approach route), fire escape (possible entry), rooftop across street (overwatch position). Plans approach for minimal exposure.
  - Calls Diane from payphone—doesn't explain plan, just thanks her for help. Diane knows what call means (goodbye), tells Kelly she was always too brave for Vegas, wishes her luck. Kelly hangs up. Last human connection severed. She's alone now, which is right—this is her mission, nobody else should die for it.
  - Final preparation: Kelly in warehouse, arranging weapons and ammunition, loading everything methodically. .38 revolver (primary), .45 automatic (backup), 9mm Beretta (third), M1 carbine (assault), shotgun (close quarters). She's carrying five guns and 140 rounds into final battle. Either overkill or not enough—she'll find out Thursday.

* **Dialogue Topics:** Brief pawn shop transactions, Kelly's goodbye call with Diane (emotional but restrained), Kelly's internal tactical planning and final thoughts, self-instruction during preparation.

* **Emotional Arc:** Kelly utterly calm—this is work, final preparation before job. No fear, no excitement, just methodical readiness. Brief warmth during Diane call, then back to cold focus.

* **Key Details:** Stolen Ford Galaxie specifications, pawn shop ammunition purchases, social club building reconnaissance and mapping, payphone goodbye, weapon loadout details (five guns, 140 rounds), body count unchanged: twenty-one total.

## Chapter 22: "Thursday Afternoon"
Target Word Count: 1,733 words
POV: Kelly Morgan, first person
Setting: Across street from social club, in stolen car
Time: Thursday afternoon into evening

* **Purpose:** Build tension before final assault, show Kelly's mental state and reflections before probable death.

* **Beats:**
  - Kelly parked across Fremont Street from Lucky Seven Pawn Shop, watching through binoculars. Thursday afternoon, mob guys starting to arrive. Counts them: six guards outside (rotating shifts), targets arriving through evening—recognizes faces from years of serving them drinks. They're comfortable, routine, don't expect attack anymore (Kelly's been quiet since Baxter fight three days ago).
  - 6pm: Torrino arrives in black Cadillac, flanked by bodyguards. Kelly watches him enter—older, fat, smoking cigar, laughing at something. Man who ordered Tommy killed, doesn't remember doing it (just another problem solved). She feels nothing watching him—no rage, no hatred, just cold purpose. He's target, needs eliminating.
  - Kelly checks weapons compulsively: loads checked, safeties off, rounds chambered. Ritual of preparation, keeping hands busy. Sun sets, neon blazes on—Vegas coming alive in electric color. She thinks about Tommy (not grief—just memory), her father teaching her to shoot jackrabbits in Searchlight, how she ended up here age 22 preparing to die killing mobsters.
  - More targets arriving through evening—Kelly counts twelve inside total including Torrino (Paulie's intelligence accurate), six outside guards. Eighteen men. She's got 140 rounds, five guns, element of surprise. Math still doesn't work (too many guns) but she's doing it anyway. Plans to hit guards first, breach building, kill everyone inside starting with Torrino.
  - Night fully dark now, 10pm approaching. Kelly thinking: not regret exactly, just observation of strange path from cocktail waitress to vigilante. Decides Tommy would've told her don't do this, live instead. But she doesn't want to live—wants them dead more than she wants anything. That's enough reason. Chambers round in M1 carbine, opens car door. Time.

* **Dialogue Topics:** None (observation and internal monologue), Kelly's memories of Tommy and father, her assessment of targets and odds, final mental goodbyes and acceptance.

* **Emotional Arc:** Kelly moves from cold observation through brief reflection to absolute calm. She's ready to die, accepted it, at peace with choice. No fear left.

* **Key Details:** Fremont Street neon lighting, Torrino's arrival and appearance, target count (18 total), weapon checking ritual, sunset into Vegas night, Kelly's mental inventory of life, final preparation, body count unchanged: twenty-one total.

## Chapter 23: "Dark Moment"
Target Word Count: 1,733 words
POV: Kelly Morgan, first person
Setting: Rooftop across from social club
Time: Thursday 10pm, immediately before assault

* **Purpose:** Kelly's final moment of doubt before commitment, mathematical realization she can't win but choosing to attack anyway.

* **Beats:**
  - Kelly moves to assault position: rooftop of adjacent building (accessed through fire escape). Sets up with binoculars and carbine, watching social club through window. Can see inside—Torrino holding court, eight guys visible inside, money on table (weekly skim count), everyone drinking, comfortable. Six guards outside on street.
  - Kelly does final math: fourteen visible targets (minimum), she's got 140 rounds. Ten rounds per target if perfect accuracy (impossible). She'll drop maybe six before they return effective fire, another three-four in firefight before getting hit. Won't get them all. Probably won't get Torrino (he'll escape through basement like Paulie said).
  - Moment of despair—can't finish this. Going to die incomplete, Torrino survives, some mob guys live, Tommy unavenged. Mission failure. Kelly considers retreat: leave Vegas, survive, live. Tommy's dead either way, her dying doesn't fix it. Logical choice is run.
  - Then sees Torrino through binoculars: laughing at joke, smoking cigar, counting money, safe and casual in his power. Man who murdered her boyfriend like swatting fly, doesn't remember Tommy's name, will die old and rich if she doesn't stop him. Kelly decides: can't kill them all, but can kill him. That's victory enough.
  - Resolution: Kelly chambers round, checks magazines, prepares for assault. Accepts she's dying tonight but Torrino dies too. Maybe several others. Better than nothing. She's not winning—she's completing mission as much as possible before death. That's enough. Stands up, moves to fire escape, begins descent. No more doubt.

* **Dialogue Topics:** None (pure internal monologue), Kelly's mathematical assessment, her moment of temptation to flee, decision process for continuing despite certain death.

* **Emotional Arc:** Kelly experiences her only real doubt—contemplates survival versus mission. Despair at impossible odds. Then resolution: mission matters more than survival. Peace in final commitment.

* **Key Details:** Rooftop observation position, binoculars view into social club (money, drinks, comfort), target count mathematics, ammunition shortage analysis, Torrino's casual safety, fire escape descent beginning, body count unchanged: twenty-one total.

## Chapter 24: "The Assault Begins"
Target Word Count: 1,733 words
POV: Kelly Morgan, first person
Setting: Social club exterior and alley
Time: Thursday 10:15pm

* **Purpose:** Kelly initiates final assault, eliminating exterior guards and breaching building in spectacular violence.

* **Beats:**
  - Kelly approaches social club from alley behind building, moving silent and fast. First guard in alley (posted at back door): she kills him with knife (silent, throat cut—brutal but quiet). Takes his shotgun, leaves body in shadows. One down, thirteen visible remaining.
  - Moves to side street where second guard smokes cigarette. Kelly shoots him point-blank with suppressed .38—except she doesn't have suppressor. Gunshot loud, guard drops. Third guard around corner turning—she shoots him twice, drops him. Alarm raised now, no more stealth.
  - Three outside guards rushing from front—Kelly opens up with taken shotgun, drops two with buckshot at close range. Third wounded, retreating inside screaming warnings. Front door reinforced but side window accessible (ground floor). Kelly crashes through window, glass exploding, rolling into social club main room.
  - Inside: chaos. Four mob guys scrambling for weapons, Torrino diving behind desk, money scattering. Kelly on ground, comes up firing M1 carbine on full auto—thirty-round magazine spraying room. Drops two guys immediately, third hit and falling, fourth behind bar returning fire. Rounds hitting walls around her, plaster exploding.
  - Firefight erupts in close quarters—Kelly behind overturned table, three-four mob guys shooting from cover, muzzle flashes strobing, deafening gunfire in enclosed space. She's firing .45 automatic now (carbine empty), methodical aimed shots. Drops one more. Looks for Torrino—basement door open, he escaped. Rage and focus: need to finish remaining guys, then pursue.

* **Dialogue Topics:** Guards' brief shouts of alarm, mob guys' panicked warnings ("She's here!" "Shoot her!"), Kelly's tactical self-commands, Torrino's shouted orders before fleeing.

* **Emotional Arc:** Kelly cold and focused during approach, pure combat adrenaline during assault, frustration when Torrino escapes but determined to finish all targets.

* **Key Details:** Alley approach and knife kill, shotgun acquisition, gunfire alarm, window breach, M1 carbine full-auto specifications, close-quarters firefight chaos, overturned furniture cover, Torrino's escape to basement, body count: twenty-seven total (six killed this chapter).

## Chapter 25: "Interior Battle"
Target Word Count: 1,733 words
POV: Kelly Morgan, first person
Setting: Social club interior
Time: Immediately following Chapter 24

* **Purpose:** Kelly fights through remaining interior guards despite being wounded, clearing path to pursue Torrino.

* **Beats:**
  - Standoff in social club: Kelly behind table, three mob guys behind bar and doorway. They're shooting, she's shooting, stalemate. She's running low on ammunition—.45 magazine near empty, reaches for 9mm Beretta. Knows she needs to break stalemate fast or they'll pin her until reinforcements arrive.
  - Kelly throws desk lamp at bar (creating distraction), rushes forward firing Beretta. Aggressive move catches them off-guard—drops one soldier with headshot. Second soldier rises to shoot—she shoots him twice, center mass. Third soldier (older guy, Mickey's brother) charges her with knife—she shotguns him at five feet, devastating blast.
  - Moment of silence. Three more dead. Kelly's ears ringing from gunfire, can barely hear. Checks herself—hit once (shoulder wound, bullet through, painful but functional). Blood running down arm. Adrenaline masking pain. Searches room for more targets—all down, dead or dying.
  - Finds basement door open (Torrino's escape route). Picks up dropped .38 revolver from dead guard, checks load. Descends wooden stairs into darkness—old bootlegger tunnels from 1940s (Paulie mentioned them). Torrino's down there somewhere, armed, cornered. Her shoulder's bleeding freely, vision swimming from blood loss. Doesn't matter—she's finishing this.
  - Kelly enters tunnel system: brick walls, bare bulbs, wine racks from old speakeasy operations. Follows sound of footsteps deeper. Cat-and-mouse hunt beginning in underground. Can hear Torrino ahead, breathing heavy, trying to move quiet. She pursues, gun ready, accepting this is where she dies probably. Fine—just needs him dead first.

* **Dialogue Topics:** Mob guys' shooting coordination attempts, Kelly's aggressive battle cries during rush, dying guards' last words, Kelly's labored breathing and pain assessment, Torrino's distant movement sounds in tunnel.

* **Emotional Arc:** Kelly fully in combat mode—pure violence and focus. Takes wound without stopping, driven by momentum and bloodlust. Predator mentality hunting Torrino into tunnels.

* **Key Details:** Bar firefight positioning, lamp-throw distraction, close-range shotgun effectiveness, shoulder gunshot wound (through-and-through), basement stairs descent, tunnel system description (1940s bootlegger architecture), body count: thirty total (three killed this chapter).

## Chapter 26: "Basement Hunt"
Target Word Count: 1,733 words
POV: Kelly Morgan, first person
Setting: Underground bootlegger tunnels beneath social club
Time: Immediately following Chapter 25

* **Purpose:** Final confrontation between Kelly and Torrino in claustrophobic underground setting.

* **Beats:**
  - Kelly stalking through tunnels, following sound of Torrino's movement. Wounded shoulder throbbing, blood dripping, leaving trail. Vision narrowing from blood loss but adrenaline keeping her functional. Brick tunnels branch—multiple paths, dim lighting, shadows everywhere. She moves careful, gun ready.
  - Gunshot from darkness—Torrino firing at her, misses. Muzzle flash reveals his position: thirty feet ahead, behind wine rack. Kelly returns fire, empties .38 revolver (six shots), forces him deeper into tunnels. Reloads with speedloader, pursues. He's panicked, she's methodical.
  - Torrino shouting from darkness: "You want money? I'll pay! Hundred thousand! Walk away rich!" Kelly silent, advancing. Another offer: "You want out of Vegas? I'll arrange it—new identity, fresh start!" She doesn't respond, just keeps coming. He's never dealt with someone who wants him dead more than they want to live.
  - Kelly corners him in dead-end tunnel (wine cellar, nowhere to run). He's got revolver, she's got .38. Both wounded (she's hit once, he's grazed from earlier firefight), exhausted. Standoff in flashlight beams—she sees his face clearly. Old, fat, scared. Not cartoon villain anymore, just terrified old man who killed too many people.
  - Torrino: "Why? I don't even know you!" Kelly: "Tommy Delano. Blackjack dealer. You had him killed." Recognition flickers: "The dealer kid? That's what this is about?" Admits he ordered it, doesn't remember clearly—just another problem handled. Kelly shoots him twice (chest). He falls, gasping. She approaches, stands over him.

* **Dialogue Topics:** Torrino's desperate bribery attempts, his pleas and negotiation, Kelly's cold silence and eventual single explanation ("Tommy Delano"), Torrino's dismissive recognition and admission.

* **Emotional Arc:** Kelly mechanical and relentless during hunt, brief satisfaction when she corners him, cold clarity during final exchange. No triumph—just completion of task.

* **Key Details:** Tunnel maze navigation, gunfight in darkness (muzzle flashes only light), wine cellar dead-end, flashlight confrontation, Torrino's physical reality (scared old man not movie villain), Tommy's name spoken aloud, body count: thirty-one total (Torrino shot but not dead yet).

## Chapter 27: "The Reckoning"
Target Word Count: 1,733 words
POV: Kelly Morgan, first person
Setting: Underground tunnel and social club aftermath
Time: Immediately following Chapter 26

* **Purpose:** Torrino's death completed, Kelly's hollow victory, escape from crime scene before police arrival.

* **Beats:**
  - Torrino dying on tunnel floor, two chest wounds, gasping for air. Kelly standing over him, gun aimed. He's trying to speak: "Just business... nothing personal..." She shoots him third time (headshot), execution. Vincent "Knuckles" Torrino dead. Man who killed Tommy, man who ran Vegas mob skim, dead in bootlegger tunnel. Poetic maybe.
  - Kelly stands there waiting to feel something—triumph, satisfaction, grief resolved. Feels nothing. Empty. Tommy's still dead, she's still broken, killing Torrino didn't fix it. Just completed task. That's all revenge is—accounting, not healing. She accepts this hollowness as victory enough.
  - Climbs back upstairs through carnage. Social club is slaughterhouse—twelve bodies (she counts them), blood everywhere, smell of gunpowder and death. Money scattered on floor (the skim cash they were counting). She doesn't take it—not here for money, never was. Leaves it.
  - Kelly retrieves Tommy's notebook from her jacket, places it on Torrino's desk (upstairs). Evidence of why this happened: names, dates, skim operation details. If police actually investigate (they won't), answers are here. Tommy's documentation becomes his monument. She leaves it as final statement.
  - Sirens approaching (neighbors called police minutes ago, took time to respond to Fremont Street). Kelly exits through alley, stumbling from blood loss. Gets to stolen Ford, drives away as police cars arrive. Twelve dead bodies behind her, war completed. She's wounded badly, vision blurring, needs to drive east into desert. Toward Searchlight maybe, or just away.

* **Dialogue Topics:** Torrino's dying words, Kelly's execution statement, her internal hollow realization about revenge, police sirens and shouted commands arriving, Kelly's labored self-instruction to move.

* **Emotional Arc:** Kelly expects catharsis, feels nothing—just emptiness. Accepts this as nature of revenge. Mechanical completion overrides emotion. Some satisfaction in leaving evidence.

* **Key Details:** Headshot execution, Tommy's notebook placed on desk, body count total (twelve in club), skim money left behind, police response timing, escape through alley, blood loss symptoms, body count: thirty-two total (final).

## Chapter 28: "Escape"
Target Word Count: 1,733 words
POV: Kelly Morgan, first person
Setting: Boulder Highway heading east into desert
Time: Thursday midnight, immediately after escape

* **Purpose:** Kelly's physical collapse and rescue, transition from vengeance to survival.

* **Beats:**
  - Kelly driving stolen Ford east on Boulder Highway, leaving Vegas lights behind. Shoulder wound bleeding badly, blood soaking shirt, dripping on seat. Vision blurring, hands weak on wheel. Knows she's going into shock, needs medical attention. Can't go to hospital (cops will grab her), can't stop in populated areas. Just drives.
  - Passing familiar landmarks—Henderson, then nothing but desert. Heading toward Searchlight (her hometown, 40 miles out). Thinking about her father's old house, dying there maybe, full circle. But vision's too blurred, can't see road clearly. Pulls into abandoned gas station (closed years ago), stops car.
  - Kelly stumbles out, leans against building wall. Tries to treat shoulder: wraps it with torn shirt, stops bleeding enough to survive short-term. But she's lost lot of blood, weak, cold despite summer heat. Sits against wall watching sunrise over desert—orange and pink, beautiful. Tommy's avenged. That's all that matters. Vision darkens, she passes out.
  - Time jump (Kelly unconscious): Someone finding her—Diane. Head cocktail waitress somehow tracked her down (Kelly mentioned Searchlight once, Diane guessed route, drove out looking). Loads unconscious Kelly into car, drives to backroom doctor (criminal-friendly clinic in Henderson). Pays cash, no questions.
  - Kelly wakes briefly in clinic—sees Diane's face, tries to speak. Diane tells her: "Shut up, rest. You did it." Kelly passes out again. Safe for now, wounded but alive. Unexpected survival.

* **Dialogue Topics:** Kelly's internal monologue during drive (fragments, confused from blood loss), brief exchange with Diane when waking (minimal—Kelly can barely speak), doctor's clinical commands.

* **Emotional Arc:** Kelly drifting from determination through delirium to acceptance of death, then surprised relief at Diane's rescue. Grateful but too exhausted to process it.

* **Key Details:** Boulder Highway route, Henderson landmarks, abandoned gas station description, sunrise over Nevada desert, blood loss symptoms (vision blur, weakness, cold), makeshift bandaging, Diane's appearance (unexplained how she knew), backroom clinic, body count unchanged: thirty-two total.

## Chapter 29: "Aftermath"
Target Word Count: 1,733 words
POV: Kelly Morgan, first person
Setting: Henderson backroom clinic
Time: Two days later, Saturday afternoon

* **Purpose:** Establish consequences and aftermath of Kelly's war, Vegas mob in chaos, Kelly alive but fugitive.

* **Beats:**
  - Kelly wakes in clinic—small room, medical equipment, backroom operation (doctor treats criminals, no reporting). She's been unconscious two days. Shoulder wound treated (cleaned, stitched, bandaged properly), IV in arm for blood loss, antibiotics running. Painful but will live. Doctor (old guy, seen everything) tells her: "You'll make it. Don't come back."
  - Diane sitting bedside, explains situation: Vegas is chaos. Torrino's entire organization collapsed—twelve guys dead at social club including boss, another twenty dead in previous weeks. Power vacuum, rival families fighting over territory, mob war brewing. Police investigating mass murder, thirty-two dead mob guys in three weeks, but nobody cooperating with cops. Cases going nowhere.
  - Kelly's description circulating (blonde cocktail waitress) but nobody's saying her name. Street legend forming: "The Waitress Who Killed Knuckles Torrino." Some people think she's myth, others know she's real. Either way, Vegas underworld is terrified—if cocktail waitress can kill thirty-two made guys, nobody's safe. Entire power structure destabilized.
  - Diane gives Kelly cash ($800—collected from other casino workers, solidarity donation) and tells her: "Leave Vegas, don't come back. They'll kill you if you stay." Kelly nods, knows she's right. Vegas took Tommy, took her youth, took everything—she's done feeding it. Time to leave.
  - Final conversation: Diane asks if it was worth it. Kelly thinks: Tommy's still dead, she's still broken, thirty-two bodies don't fix anything. But Torrino's dead too, and that matters. "Yeah. It was worth it." Diane leaves, last goodbye. Kelly alone in clinic room, wounded but alive, legendary but empty.

* **Dialogue Topics:** Doctor's clinical assessment and warning, Diane's explanation of Vegas aftermath and mob war, Diane's advice to leave, street legend discussion, Diane's question about worth, Kelly's affirmative response.

* **Emotional Arc:** Kelly grateful for survival but emotionally hollow. Satisfaction at Torrino's death and mob chaos but no joy. Acceptance that revenge doesn't heal—just settles accounts. Ready to leave.

* **Key Details:** Clinic room description, medical treatment details (IV, antibiotics, stitches), two-day unconsciousness, Vegas mob power vacuum and war, police investigation failure, street legend myth-building, cash donation, body count final: thirty-two total.

## Chapter 30: "Neon Knights"
Target Word Count: 1,733 words
POV: Kelly Morgan, first person
Setting: Greyhound bus station and bus to California
Time: One week after social club assault

* **Purpose:** Kelly's departure from Vegas and final reflections, establishing her survival but permanent scarring.

* **Beats:**
  - Kelly at Greyhound station (downtown Vegas), buying one-way ticket to San Francisco. Changed appearance again: short brown hair, sunglasses, nondescript clothes. Shoulder healing under jacket, scars forming. Looks like thousand other young women leaving Vegas—broke, used up, moving on. Anonymous again, which is right.
  - Waiting for bus, Kelly watches Vegas through station windows. Daytime Vegas—neon looks cheap in sunlight, city looks tired and dirty without darkness to hide it. She lived here four years, served drinks to men who thought she was furniture, killed thirty-two of them. City doesn't care—keeps running, keeps eating people. Someone else is serving those cocktails now.
  - Bus arrives, Kelly boards with small bag (father's .38 revolver hidden inside, $600 remaining, nothing else). Takes window seat, bus pulls out. Watches Vegas recede in distance—neon glittering even in daylight, Strip in one direction, Fremont Street in other. Somewhere back there, Tommy's still buried in desert. She couldn't save him, but avenged him. Mathematics of revenge: thirty-two for one.
  - Kelly thinking: She's 22, famous in Vegas underworld, broken permanently, going to California with nothing. Tommy would've told her don't do this, live instead. But she doesn't regret it—needed them dead more than she needed future. Got what she wanted, even if it didn't fix anything. Accounts settled. That's enough.
  - Bus crosses state line into California. Kelly sleeps (first peaceful sleep in weeks), gun in bag under seat, scars on shoulder, legend behind her. Vegas keeps eating its own—she's done feeding it. Somewhere ahead: new city, new name, new life maybe. Or just survival. Either way, she's finished. The End.

* **Dialogue Topics:** Brief ticket purchase exchange, bus driver's announcements, Kelly's internal reflections and final assessment of revenge, imagined conversation with Tommy (apologizing or explaining), self-recognition of permanent damage.

* **Emotional Arc:** Kelly calm and empty—not sad, not relieved, just finished. Acceptance of who she became and what she sacrificed. No hope for healing but satisfaction in completion. Neutral ending—survival without triumph.

* **Key Details:** Greyhound station atmosphere (transients, departures, anonymity), daytime Vegas appearance (cheap and tired), bus interior, possessions inventory (gun, cash, nothing else), state line crossing, peaceful sleep as resolution, body count final: thirty-two total.
