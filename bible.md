# VENGEANCE #5: NEON KNIGHTS - BIBLE

## Story Premise

Las Vegas, 1977. Kelly Morgan, 22-year-old cocktail waitress at Fremont Street's Golden Nugget, watches her blackjack dealer boyfriend Tommy get murdered by mob enforcers after he witnesses a casino skim operation. With nothing but Tommy's insider knowledge of Vegas mob operations, fifty thousand dollars stolen from a mob courier, and her dead father's lessons with a revolver, Kelly declares war on the entire Las Vegas organized crime family. She's young, broke, and nobody—which makes her invisible until the bodies start piling up. In six days of relentless violence across the neon jungle, Kelly Morgan tears through mob soldiers, enforcers, and lieutenants with reckless fury, turning from anonymous cocktail girl into the most feared name on the Strip. The mob brings in hitmen, calls in favors, locks down their operations—but Kelly knows every casino, every club, every wiseguy hangout from years of serving them drinks, and she uses that knowledge to hunt them where they live. This is her city now, and she's painting it red.

## Protagonist Profile

**Kelly Ann Morgan, 22 years old.** Five-foot-six, lean and hard from years on her feet, shoulder-length blonde hair usually pulled back in work ponytail, green eyes that went cold the night Tommy died. Wears jeans, boots, and men's work shirts when hunting—blends into casino crowds in cocktail uniform when needed. Pretty in a working-class way, forgettable until you see the gun.

Raised in Searchlight, Nevada (60 miles south of Vegas), daughter of copper miner who drank himself to death when she was 16. Father taught her to shoot jackrabbits and coyotes on the desert—.38 revolvers and lever-action rifles, practical shooting, nothing fancy. Mother cleaned motel rooms until lung cancer took her in 1975. Kelly moved to Vegas at 18 with $200 and a high school diploma, worked her way up from Fremont Street dives to Golden Nugget cocktail service. Four years serving drinks to dealers, pit bosses, and wiseguys taught her the invisible woman's power—they talk around you like furniture.

Met Tommy Delano six months ago—21-year-old blackjack dealer, smart, trying to save money for college, doomed the moment he saw the skim and couldn't keep quiet. They had an apartment off Charleston, talked about California, made plans that died in the desert with him.

Kelly's good with the .38 her father left her—can hit center mass at 15 yards, reload fast, doesn't flinch at recoil. Not tactical, not trained beyond desert plinking and killing varmints, but she's got steady hands and no fear of pulling the trigger. She learns on the job: takes weapons from dead enforcers, figures out shotguns and automatics through trial and error. Her real weapon is recklessness—she doesn't care if she dies, which makes her unpredictable and terrifying.

Personality is hard desert pragmatism. Doesn't waste words, doesn't cry, doesn't explain. She's got working-class silence—suffers without performing it, kills without justifying it. Talks like Searchlight: flat, direct, occasional desert-town profanity. No warmth left after Tommy, just cold purpose. She's not heroic, not trying to clean up Vegas—she's killing the men who killed her future, and if that makes her a monster, fine.

Views violence as work: methodical, efficient, necessary. Walks into mob clubs the way she walked casino floors—head up, eyes forward, do the job, get out. The terror she causes is byproduct, not goal. She doesn't want to be feared; she wants them dead.

## Villain Profile

**Vincent "Knuckles" Torrino, 52 years old.** Five-foot-eight, 220 pounds of aging muscle gone to fat, slicked-back black hair going gray, thick knuckles from decades of beating people (hence the name). Wears expensive suits poorly—always looks rumpled, tie loose, shirt straining at gut. Heavy gold rings on both hands, college class ring from UNLV he never attended (took it off a mark). Chomps unlit cigars, spits tobacco juice into brass spittoon in his office. Face like a catcher's mitt, broken nose twice, scar through left eyebrow.

Came up through Vegas mob as enforcer in 1950s, broke legs for casino bosses, graduated to running protection rackets. By 1977 he controls the skim operations at four major casinos—Golden Nugget, Fremont, Binion's, others. Not the absolute top of Vegas mob (still answers to Chicago/Kansas City families) but he's the king of Fremont Street operations. Runs crew of 40+ made guys, associates, muscle.

**Signature M.O.:** Torrino's trademark is "the desert retirement"—drives victims out to nuclear test site access roads, makes them dig their own graves in the sand, puts one round in back of head, buries them where atomic bombs already made the ground poison. Poetic in his mind—they disappear into radioactive wasteland, never found. He's done this 30+ times. Brags about it to his crew: "Give 'em the retirement package." Tommy Delano got the desert retirement.

Personality is old-school Vegas mob—loud, crude, sentimental about Frank Sinatra and the Rat Pack while murdering people. Calls women "doll" and "sweetheart," tips cocktail waitresses well, then orders hits without blinking. Quotable dialogue: "This is MY town, MY casinos, MY money," "You don't steal from Knuckles Torrino," "I built this street with these hands." Genuinely believes he's a Vegas institution, deserves respect, provides service (protection, order, entertainment).

Weakness is ego and routine. Every Thursday he holds court at his social club (back room of Fremont Street pawn shop), counts skim money, receives tribute. Every night he drinks at same bar (Golden Goose Lounge, booth in back). Surrounds himself with yes-men who don't question him. Doesn't take threats seriously until too late—can't imagine a 22-year-old cocktail waitress as legitimate danger.

Kelly's positioned to destroy him because she's invisible to his world. She served him drinks for two years, knows his schedule, knows his crew, knows where he feels safe. And she's got nothing to lose, which Torrino—who's spent 30 years accumulating power and money—can't comprehend.

## Supporting Characters

**Tommy Delano (deceased before story opens):** 21, blackjack dealer, Kelly's boyfriend. Grew up in Henderson, dealt cards since 18, witness to skim operation that got him killed. Appears in flashbacks and Kelly's memories—smart, kind, trying to do right thing, paid with desert grave. His death is the engine of the story. (150 words budget used in protagonist section)

**Frank Castellano, 45, mob lieutenant.** Torrino's number two, handles daily skim operations, smart enough to see Kelly as real threat early. Tries to convince Torrino to take her seriously—gets overruled. Thin, nervous, chain-smoker, always checking exits. Kelly kills him Chapter 14 in parking garage ambush—he's the first one who actually scared her because he understood her. His death pushes mob into panic mode. (87 words)

**Diane Porter, 38, head cocktail waitress at Golden Nugget.** Kelly's supervisor, tough broad who worked Vegas since 1960. Knows mob operations from years of watching, provides Kelly with intelligence (who's who, where they meet) without asking questions. Maternal without being soft—slips Kelly schedule changes, warns her when heat's on. Survives the story, keeps working, never speaks of Kelly again. Working-class solidarity in silence. (75 words)

**Ray "The Hammer" Kowalski, 35, mob enforcer.** Torrino's primary muscle, six-foot-four Polish brick, kills on command. Not bright but absolutely loyal, scary in his simplicity. Kelly shoots him Chapter 10 in casino kitchen—takes four rounds to put him down. His death is statement kill: if she can drop The Hammer, nobody's safe. Torrino loses confidence after this. (68 words)

**Johnny Baxter, 28, independent hitman.** Brought in from LA when Kelly's body count hits 15, professional killer, Vietnam vet, actually competent. Tracks Kelly through her patterns, almost kills her Chapter 22 in motel ambush. She survives through luck and desperation, kills him with his own gun. This near-death convinces her to go all-in on final assault—she won't survive another professional. Wiry, quiet, dead eyes. (73 words)

**Detective Lou Barker, 50, Las Vegas Metro.** Homicide cop, seen it all, knows mob runs Vegas. Investigates Kelly's murders half-heartedly—frankly doesn't care if wiseguys kill each other. Provides police perspective in couple scenes, notes that nobody's reporting the crimes, witnesses don't talk. Tells partner: "Let 'em bleed." Represents law's complete absence in mob world. Never gets Kelly's name, case goes cold unsolved. (71 words)

**Paulie "Numbers" Romano, 40, mob accountant.** Handles skim finances, knows where money goes. Kelly kidnaps him Chapter 18, forces him to reveal Torrino's Thursday meeting schedule and location. She lets him live—he runs to LA, never comes back to Vegas. His testimony to Kelly gives her the intelligence for final assault. Scared rabbit of a man, sweats constantly, just wanted to count money quietly. (70 words)

## Setting Details

**Las Vegas, Nevada, Summer 1977.** Post-Howard Hughes, pre-corporate casinos, still mob-run and dirty. Fremont Street is neon heart—Golden Nugget, Binion's Horseshoe, Fremont Hotel blazing electric cowgirls and million bulbs. Downtown working-class Vegas, not glamorous Strip. Smell of cigarettes, spilled beer, desert heat baking garbage. Sidewalks crowded with tourists, dealers, hookers, grifters, retirees pumping nickels. Old men in polyester, women in pantsuits, everyone sweating.

**Golden Nugget Casino:** Where Kelly works, where Tommy dealt blackjack. Gold rush theme, chandeliers, red carpet worn thin, cocktail waitresses in abbreviated frontier costumes. Pit bosses in bad toupees watching floor, dealers in white shirts and bow ties, cigarette smoke so thick it hazes the lights. Backrooms where mob counts skim money—Kelly knows every service corridor, kitchen, loading dock from four years navigating them with drink trays.

**Torrino's Social Club (Lucky Seven Pawn Shop back room):** Fremont Street storefront, barred windows, neon martini glass flashing. Front room: pawned guitars, TVs, jewelry—legitimate business. Back room through beaded curtain: Torrino's office, leather chairs, brass spittoon, wall safe, venetian blinds. Smells like cigar smoke and Old Spice. Where he holds Thursday court, counts money, receives tribute. No windows except front (tactical vulnerability Kelly exploits).

**Desert perimeter:** Where Tommy died, where many died before. Nuclear test site access roads, empty federal land, creosote and sagebrush, blowing sand. During day: 110 degrees, mirages on asphalt. Night: freezing, stars like broken glass, coyotes howling. Kelly goes out there Chapter 6, finds Tommy's grave by tire tracks and disturbed sand. Doesn't dig him up—just stands there, then leaves. The desert remembers.

**Paradise Palms Motel:** Where Kelly holes up between kills, $8/night rooms on Boulder Highway, truckers and prostitutes, neon palm tree flickering. Bedspreads smell like bleach, air conditioning rattles, neighbors scream through walls. Manager don't ask questions if you pay cash. Kelly keeps weapons under mattress, sleeps in clothes, always ready to run. Working-class anonymous—ten thousand rooms just like it in Vegas.

**Vegas 1977 details:** Gas $0.65/gallon, pack of cigarettes $0.50, minimum wage $2.30/hour (Kelly makes $2.50 + tips). Payphones everywhere, rotary dials. Cars: '72 Chevrolets, '75 Fords, chrome and bench seats. No computers, no security cameras, everything cash. Mob still owns casinos before corporate buyouts. Cops look other way, judges take envelopes, everyone's got angle. The wild west before it got tamed.

## Tone & Voice Guidelines

Hard-boiled pulp, Vegas noir without romanticism. Prose is lean desert prose—short sentences, concrete details, no metaphors that don't serve action. Kelly's internal voice is working-class laconic: observes, doesn't philosophize. She notes tactical details (exits, cover, sight lines), not existential meaning. When she thinks about Tommy, it's brief and cuts deep—no lingering grief prose.

Dialogue: Vegas 1970s authentic. Mob guys talk like Scorsese extras—"fuhgeddabout it," "capisce," "this thing of ours." Kelly talks like Searchlight—flat desert pragmatism, occasional "hell" or "damn," more silence than speech. Period slang: "bread" (money), "heat" (police), "made guy" (inducted mobster), "skim" (stolen casino profits). Profanity level moderate—these are violent men, they talk like it.

Violence description: graphic but efficient. "She put two rounds in his chest, one in his head, kept walking." Not torture-porn—Kelly kills fast, doesn't linger. Body counts matter numerically (running total), deaths described with technical precision (caliber, hit location, result). Blood and impact detailed but not savored. She's doing work, not art.

Pacing: relentless. Minimal descriptive breaks—setting details woven into action. Every chapter advances plot or body count. No introspection chapters, no relationship development, no philosophical breathing room. Kelly moves, kills, moves, kills. Like Executioner novels—propulsive, violent, fast. Reader should feel hunted alongside mob.

Reference points: Don Pendleton's Executioner series, Richard Stark's Parker novels, early Elmore Leonard. Reads like 1976 Pinnacle Books paperback found in truck stop spinner rack.

## Weapons & Tactics

**Primary weapon:** Smith & Wesson Model 10 .38 Special revolver (her father's gun, only possession she kept). Four-inch barrel, standard police issue, utterly reliable. Six rounds, she carries speedloader in pocket. Knows this gun intimately—reload in dark, clear jams, accurate to 20 yards. Not powerful enough for body armor or distance, but Kelly fights close.

**Acquired weapons:** Takes guns from dead enforcers. Chapter 4: Colt .45 automatic from first kills (7-round magazine, heavier recoil, she's less accurate but more stopping power). Chapter 12: Remington 870 pump shotgun from mob car (12-gauge, devastating close range, she uses for final assault). Chapter 18: stolen M1 carbine from Torrino's gun safe (Tommy's murder weapon—poetic justice she kills with it).

**Ammunition:** Always worried about running out. Carries what she can—30-40 rounds mixed calibers. Reloads in bathroom stalls, motel rooms, casino parking lots. Several scenes of her counting bullets, anxiety of finite resources against infinite enemies.

**Tactical approach:** Kelly's not trained tactical operator—she's reckless improviser. Hits them where they feel safe (social clubs, favorite bars, casino backrooms), strikes fast, escapes in chaos. Uses crowds as cover, service corridors as escape routes, stolen cars as disposable transport. More guerrilla than soldier—sudden violence, then melt away.

**Combat style:** Efficient, brutal, defensive. Fires center mass, doesn't try headshots beyond point-blank. Ambushes when possible, never fair fights. Will shoot unarmed men if they're mob—no honor code, just extermination. Gets wounded twice (grazed Chapter 16, shot in shoulder Chapter 29), keeps fighting through pain. Survival instinct kicks in when cornered—animal desperation.

**Limitations:** Doesn't know tactics, room-clearing, suppressing fire. Can't fight multiple armed opponents in open ground. Relies on surprise and knowing territory. Several near-death moments from these gaps in knowledge—survives through luck and enemy incompetence as much as skill.

## Themes

**Revenge as working-class power:** Kelly has no legal recourse—cops won't help, mob owns judges. Violence is only tool available to powerless. Revenge isn't about justice (abstract concept), it's about making them pay in only currency they understand: blood. Theme manifests in her methodical elimination of organization—she's not raging, she's working. Killing them is her job now, same as serving drinks was.

**Invisibility as weapon:** Years of being furniture (cocktail waitress, server, background woman) taught Kelly how power works—they don't see her coming because they never saw her at all. She weaponizes being underestimated. Every mob guy who called her "sweetheart" while discussing murder around her gave her intelligence. The invisible woman becomes avenging angel.

**The city eats its own:** Vegas 1977 is carnivore ecosystem—everyone using everyone, violence underneath neon veneer. Tommy's murder is system working as designed (witness elimination). Kelly's rampage is same system turned inward—she learned from them, now applies their lessons. City that runs on blood gets blood. Nobody's innocent, nobody gets out clean.

**No redemption, just reckoning:** Kelly doesn't learn moral lessons, doesn't grow, doesn't heal. She completes her task (kill everyone responsible) and either dies or leaves. No catharsis, no peace—just accounting settled. Tommy stays dead, she stays broken, but the men who killed him die screaming. That's the only resolution available. Pulp morality: evil punished, but punishment doesn't restore what was lost.
